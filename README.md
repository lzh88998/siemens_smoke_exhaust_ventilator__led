# siemens_smoke_exhaust_ventilator__led

A PCB design for siemens smoke exhaust ventilator. The PCB can be used to replace the old PCB in LED components. The LEDs in PCB are 5mm LED. 3 LEDs in series and there are 6 groups in total. Original LEDs use 150 ohm resistance, but that will lead to less current for common LEDs. This PCB leave the choice of resistance to users and usually 130 ohm resistance works well and have similar current with original design. Original current of the LED component is about 135 mA in total @ 12V DC. And with 130 ohm the current is around 138 mA for most of the LEDs.
